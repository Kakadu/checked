(** Pa_checked --- a camlp4/camlp5 syntax extension to work with [Checked] exception
    monad. 

    A new [ensure] construct is added at expression level. The construct 
    allows to bind several checked values in a row. 

    Example:

    [ensure x, y, z in Ok (x+y+z) end]

    is equivalent to

    [x -?->> (fun x -> y -?->> (fun y -> z -?->> (fun z -> Ok (x+y+z))))]

    Note that the body of [ensure] expression has to be of checked type and that
    the [ensure] key values have to be simple identifiers.

    Another flavour of [ensure] construct is introduced to provide
    pattern-matching facility. 

    Example:

    [ensure (x as Some x), (y as Some y) in Ok (x+y) end]

    The surrounding brackets are mandatory for [ensure] key values to distinguish the 
    latter variant of the construct from the former.

    The construct above is equivalent to

    [x -?->> (fun (Some x) -> y -?->> (fun (Some y) -> Ok (x+y)))]
